This gives you:
- Complete UI structure with all the visual elements you need
- Basic JavaScript framework with placeholder functions
- Event listeners already set up
- Display update functions that work with your game state
- Sample data structures for cards
- Message system for user feedback
- Progress bar for the work mechanic

You can now implement your game logic in the placeholder functions like work(),
takeFairRisk(), takeUnwiseRisk(), buyCard(), etc.
The UI will automatically update when you call updateDisplay().
